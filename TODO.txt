-- TODO
    Add the rest of the native commands.
    Have the InputValidator.java class handle input validation.
    Add the input loop.
    Allow command chaining using "&&" or semicolons.
    Add aliases? -- Difficult to do at this stage...
    Send TCP requests to lights based off of the commands that have run.
    Make custom errors?
    Maybe I could give the user more control over the sequences by giving them a timeline that they can place patterns along.
    If two patterns overlap, should I make it throw an error or have one take priority over the other?
