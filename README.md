What is LifxControl?
====================

LifxControl is a pet project of mine that I have been developing on and off for a few years now.
It aims to be an easy-to-use text based prompter that allows users to manage LIFX lights on their local network via TCP/UDP messages.


What is in the future for LifxControl?
======================================

I aim to add a GUI version of this program sometime in the future.  I have the basics down already in the [GUI-Development](https://github.com/Turbojax07/LifxControl/tree/GUI-Development) branch, but that only allows you to interact with 3 lights on your network, and doesn't like working very well in general.
