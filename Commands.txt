Overall Tips:
Objects can be given aliases.  However, any created aliases cannot match variable names or commands.
You cannot name objects or commands with spaces.
This check is also performed when renaming variables, so nothing will have the same name.

Command: delPattern
Function: Deletes a pattern object.

Command: addPatternGroup
Function: Creates a new pattern group object.
Group Types:
    There are 2 valid group types, those being "parallel" and "sequential"
    The reason that the type parameter exists is so that users can run multiple patterns at once.
    If the user doesn't specify a valid type, then the type will default to sequential.
    Sequential mode: Runs each pattern one after the other, ending when the patterns finish or the duration of the pattern group expires.
Usage: addPatternGroup <groupName> [options...]
        -a <patternName>    The name of the patterns to add to the group (can be repeated)
        -d <seconds>        The amount of time the pattern group should run in seconds (overrides any previous times set)
        -h                  Displays this help message
        -t <groupType>      The new type of the pattern group

Command: modPatternGroup
Function: Allows users to modify attributes of a pattern group such as its name, type, affected patterns, and more.
Group Types:
    There are 2 valid group types, those being "parallel" and "sequential"
    The reason that the type parameter exists is so that users can run multiple patterns at once.
    If the user doesn't specify a valid type, then the type will default to sequential.
    Sequential mode: Runs each pattern one after the other, ending when the patterns finish or the duration of the pattern group expires.
